#Consider this fragment of code:
import turtle
tess = turtle.Turtle()
alex = tess
alex.color("hotpink")
"""Does this fragment create one or two turtle instances? Does setting the
color of alex also change the color of tess? Explain in detail."""
#Since you are assigning Alex to Tess, they are considered the same. So when you change one you also change the other. Also, since they are the same, you only make one turtle.
